			<p class="story-title">Background</p>

			<p class="story-copy">Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes which bite
			between dusk and dawn. People infected with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness at first.
			Left untreated, the disease can lead to severe complications and, in some cases, death.<p>

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<p class="story-copy">Malaria in humans is caused by five species of parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium.
				Four of these – P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale – are human malaria species that are spread
				from one person to another via the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. There are about 400
				different species of Anopheles mosquitoes, but only 30 of these are vectors of major importance. In recent
				years, human cases of malaria due to P. knowlesi have been recorded – this species causes malaria among
				monkeys in certain forested areas of South-East Asia.<p>

			<p class="story-copy">Current information suggests that P. knowlesi malaria is
				not spread from person to person, but rather occurs in people when an Anopheles mosquito infected by a
				monkey then bites and infects humans (zoonotic transmission). P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most
				prevalent, and P. falciparum is the most dangerous, with the highest rates of complications and mortality. This
				deadly form of malaria is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.<p>

			<p class="story-title">Moving forward</p>

			<p class="story-copy">To address remaining challenges in global malaria control and elimination, WHO has developed the Global
				Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the strategy
				provides a technical framework for all endemic countries as they work towards malaria control and elimination.
				This Global Technical Strategy sets ambitious but achievable goals for 2030, including: reducing malaria case
				incidence by at least 90%; reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90%; eliminating malaria in at least 35
				countries; preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free. To achieve these targets,
				annual funding for malaria will need to triple over the next 15-year period, from US$ 2.7 billion (current level of
				spending) to US$ 8.7 billion by 2030.<p>
